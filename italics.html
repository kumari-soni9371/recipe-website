            <h2 style="color: crimson;"><u>Instructions:-</u></h2>
            <h3>Make the Dough:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>In a bowl, combine the warm water, sugar, and yeast. Stir and let it sit for about 5 minutes, until it becomes foamy.</li>
                <li>Add olive oil, salt, and flour. Mix until the dough starts to come together.</li>
                <li>Knead the dough on a floured surface for about 5-7 minutes, until smooth and elastic.</li>
                <li>Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl, cover it with a clean kitchen towel, and let it rise in a warm place for about 1 hour, or until it doubles in size.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Preheat Oven:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Preheat your oven to 475°F (245°C). If you're using a pizza stone, place it in the oven to heat up as well.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Shape the Dough:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Once the dough has risen, punch it down gently and roll it out on a floured surface into your desired pizza shape (round or rectangular).</li>
                <li>Transfer the dough to a baking sheet or pizza stone lined with parchment paper.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Add the Sauce and Toppings:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Spread a thin layer of pizza sauce over the dough, leaving a small border around the edges for the crust.</li>
                <li>Sprinkle the shredded mozzarella cheese evenly over the sauce.</li>
                <li>Add any other toppings of your choice (e.g., pepperoni, vegetables, olives, etc.).</li>
                <li>Sprinkle some grated Parmesan cheese over the top, if desired.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Bake the Pizza:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Place the pizza in the oven and bake for 10-12 minutes, or until the crust is golden and the cheese is bubbly and melted.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Serve:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Once the pizza is done, remove it from the oven and let it cool for a couple of minutes.</li>
                <li>Slice and serve hot!</li>
